        <p style="background-color: aqua;">Extensive overbuying has significant negative impacts, both environmentally and socially. It leads to increased waste, resource depletion, and a higher carbon footprint, as goods are often discarded unused, contributing to pollution and climate change. Financially, overbuying strains individuals through debt accumulation and reduced savings, while also fostering buyerâ€™s remorse and stress due to cluttered living spaces. Economically, it disrupts supply chains, creates artificial demand, and can cause price inflation, making essential goods less accessible to those in need. Moreover, overbuying deepens social inequities, as it often leaves lower-income groups with fewer resources during shortages. On a larger scale, it normalizes a culture of materialism and shortens product lifecycles, promoting unsustainable consumption patterns.</p>
